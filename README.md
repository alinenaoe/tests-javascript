## Counting vowels - Practicing TDD

This is the solution of the challenge proposed by Jos√©lia Costa during the workshop "Conserta aqui e quebra ali: hora do TDD no JavaScript". The activity was part of the program of [DoWhile](https://dowhile.rocketseat.com.br/evento), a [RocketSeat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) event.


Using the principles of Test Driven Development, the project uses the JavaScript testing framework Jest to develop a function that receives a string and return the number of vowels.


#### Requirements:

- Should be a function
- Should be considered as vowels: a, e, i, o, u
- The argument can be a single word or a sentence
- The function should return an error if the parameter is not a string
- It should count uppercase and lowercase vowels


### Run the project
